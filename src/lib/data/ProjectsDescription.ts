	longDescription: `This web application provides users with real-time hourly and weekly weather forecasts based on their exact geographical location. Developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the application leverages modern web technologies to deliver an intuitive and responsive user experience.

<b><br/> Key Features </b><br/>
<li> <b>Location-Based Forecasts:</b> The app uses the Geolocation API to automatically fetch weather data for the user's current location, ensuring accurate and relevant information.</li>
<li> <b>Default Locations:</b> For users who prefer not to share their location, the app offers four preset default locations. Users can easily select any of these locations to view the hourly and weekly weather forecasts.</li>
<li> <b>Error Handling:</b> In the event that a user denies permission for location access, the app redirects to a user-friendly 403 error page, clearly explaining the need for location access and offering options to select a default location.
<br/><br/><b>Technical Details</b><br/>
<li> <b>Frontend Technologies:</b> Built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic content and API interactions.The application is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
<li> <b>Data Source:</b> The weather data is fetched from a reliable weather API, ensuring up-to-date and accurate forecasts.</li>
<li> <b>Deployment:</b> The project is hosted on Netlify, providing seamless deployment and continuous integration capabilities.</li>

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in web development but also highlights my ability to create user-centered applications. The integration of location services with error handling and default options showcases a thoughtful approach to user experience. I am excited to further enhance this application with additional features, such as user preferences and historical weather data. <br/>
